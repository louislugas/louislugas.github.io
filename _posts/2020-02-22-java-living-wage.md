Sometimes in the past, if my memories are right, I once looked at one map that shows the most cheap living cities in Indonesia, based on the minimum wage and the living cost in that city. Years after, I search again the map, and I found nothing. But then I found the similar map about living-wage in United States, written in this [article][article]. The article shows a lot of map, but the interactive map itself is not available anymore. But the tool, called the [Living Wage Calculator][calculator] made by MIT are still available online. So I go checked how the calculator worked, and happily they also published the technical documentation and research method, complete with any assumption needed.

Inspired by the calculator, and the "missing" interactive map, I tried to make it by myself. After collecting some dataset, that was not as 





















You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
